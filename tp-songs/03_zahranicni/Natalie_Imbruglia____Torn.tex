<F>I thought I saw a man brought to life

<Ami>He was warm, he came around like he was <Bb>dignified

He showed me what it was to cry

<F>Well you couldn't be that man I adored 

<Ami>You don't seem to know. Don't seem to care what your <Bb>heart is for

But I don't know him anymore 

There's <Dmi>nothing where he used to lie

<C>My conversation has run dry

<Ami>That's what's going on

<C>Nothing's fine

I'm <F>torn
\ks

\zr
I'm all out of <C>faith, this is how I <Dmi>feel

I'm cold and I am <Bb>shamed, lying naked on the <F>floor

Illusion never <C>changed into something <Dmi>real

I'm wide awake and <Bb>I can see the perfect sky is <F>torn

You're a little <C>late, I'm already <Dmi>torn <Bb>

So I guess the fortune teller's right

I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

But you crawl beneath my veins and now

I don't care, I have no luck

I don't miss it all that much 

There's just so many things

That I can't touch

I'm torn

...<Dmi>Torn...

Bridge: (bass only)

<Dmi>Ooooh... Hoo <F>ooooh... <C>Ooooh

There's <Dmi>nothing where he used to lie

<C>My conversation has run dry

<Ami>That's what's going on

<C>Nothing's fine

I'm <F>torn
