I'm <A>broke but I'm <Asus2>happy,
I'm <Asus4>sore but I'm <Asus2>kind

I'm <A>short but I'm <Asus2>healthy, <A>yeah,
I'm <A>high but I'm <Asus2>grounded

I'm <Asus4>sane but I'm <Asus2>overwhelmed,
I'm <A>lost but I'm <Asus2>hopeful, <A>baby
\ks

\zr
And <Asus2>what it all comes <G6>down to <D>

I feel drunk but I'm sober,
I'm young and I'm underpaid

I'm dyin' but I'm workin', yeah,
I care but I'm restless

I'm here but I'm really gone,
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby
\ks

\zr
And what it all comes down to

Is that ev'rything's gonna be quite alright

Cause I got one hand in my pocket
and the other one is flickin' a cigarette
\kr

\zr
And what it all comes down to

Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet

Cause I got one hand in my pocket
and the other one is givin' a peace sign
\kr

\zs
I'm free but I'm focused,
I'm green but I'm wise

I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby,
I'm sad but I'm laughin'

I'm brave but I'm chickenshit,
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby
\ks

\zr
And what it all boils down to

Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet

Well I got one hand in my pocket
and the other one is playin' a piano
\kr

\zr
And what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah

Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine

Cause I got one hand in my pocket
and the other one is hailing a taxi cab
\kr
