\zp{Lemon tree}{Fool's Garden}

\zs
I'm <Dmi>sitting here in a <Ami>boring room

It's <Dmi>just another rainy Sunday <A7>afternoon

I'm <Dmi>wasting my time I got <Ami>nothing to do

I'm <Gmi>hanging around and I'm <A7>waiting for you

But <Gmi>nothing ever happens <A7>-- and I <Dmi>wonder <Ami> <Dmi>
\ks

\zs
I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast and I'm driving too far

I'd like to change my point of view, I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you

But nothing ever happens -- and I wonder
\ks

\zr
I <F>wonder how, I <C>wonder why

<Dmi>Yesterday you told me 'bout the <Ami>blue blue sky

And <B>all that I can <C>see is just a yellow <F>lemon tree <C>

I'm <F>turning my head <C>up and down

I'm <Dmi>turning turning turning turning <Ami>turning around

And <B>all that I can <C>see is just a yellow <F>lemon tree

I'm sitting here, I miss the power, I'd like to go out, taking a shower

But there's a heavy cloud inside my head, I feel so tired, put myself into bed

Where nothing ever happens -- and I wonder
\ks

<A7>Isolation -- <Dmi>it's not good for me

<C>Isolation -- <F>I don't <B>want to <A7>sit on a lemon tree

\zs
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy, baby anyhow I'll get another toy

And everything will happen -- and you'll wonder
