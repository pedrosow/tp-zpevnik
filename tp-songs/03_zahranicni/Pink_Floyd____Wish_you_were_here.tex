<C>So, so you think you can <D>tell

Heaven from <Ami>hell, blue sky from <G>pain

Can you tell a green <D>field from a cold steel <C>rail

A smile from a <Ami>veil

Do you think you can <G>tell?

And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts

Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze

Cold comfort for change
and did you exchange

A walk on part in the war

For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year

Running over the same old ground, what have we found?

The same old fears

Wish you were here!
