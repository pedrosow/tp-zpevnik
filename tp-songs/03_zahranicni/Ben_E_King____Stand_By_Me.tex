When the <A>night has come

And the <F#mi>land is dark

And the <D>moon is the <E>only light we'll <A>see

No, I won't be afraid

No, I won't be afraid

Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darling, darling, stand by me

Oh, stand by me

Oh, stand, stand by me

Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

Or the mountain should crumble in the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you stand, stand by me
