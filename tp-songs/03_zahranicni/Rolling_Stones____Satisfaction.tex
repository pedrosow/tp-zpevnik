When I'm watchin' my TV

And that man comes on to tell me

How white my shirts can be

Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke

The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no

Oh no no no, hey hey hey

That's what I say

\zs
When I'm ridin' 'round the world

And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that

And I'm tryin' to make some girl who tells me:

Baby better come back next week

Cause you see I'm on a losin' streak
