In the <E>summertime when the weather is high
 
You can stretch right up and touch the sky

When the <A>weather is fine, you got women, you got women on your <E>mind

Have a <B>drink, have a drive

<A>Go out and see what you can <E>find

\zs
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
 
If her daddy's poor, just do as you feel

Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
 
When the sun goes down

You can make it make it good in a lay-by
\ks

\zs
We're not grey people, we're not dirty, we're not mean
 
We love everybody but we do as we please

When the weather is fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea

We're always happy

Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy
\ks

\zs
Sing along with us, da da di di di 
 
Da da da da, yeah, we're happy 

Da da da da, di di di di di da da da 

Da da da da

Da da da da da da da da da da da da

When the winter's here, yeah, it's party-time,
 
Bring a bottle, wear your bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime

And we'll sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down
 
If she's rich, if she's nice

Bring your friend and we will all go into town
