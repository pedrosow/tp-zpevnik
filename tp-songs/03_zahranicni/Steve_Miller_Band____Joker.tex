<F>Some <B>people call me the space <C>cowboy, yeah~<B> ~ <F>

Some call me the gangster of love

Some people call me Maurice

Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

People talk about me, baby

Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong

Well, don't you worry baby, don't worry

Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
\ks
\zr

Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner

I play my music in the sun
\bigskip

I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker

I sure don't want to hurt no one
\kr

\zs
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see

I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree

Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time

Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time

... I get my lovin' on the run
