<D>Left a good job in the city,

Workin for the man every night and day

And I never lost one minute of sleepin'

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

<A>Big wheels keep on turnin'

<Hmi>Proud Mary keep on <G>burnin'

/: <D>Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river :/

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis

Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans

But I never saw the good side of the city

Till I hitched a ride <A>on a river boat queen

<D>If you come down to the river

Bet you're gonna find some people who live

You don't have to worry, 'cause you have no money

People on the river are <A>happy to give
