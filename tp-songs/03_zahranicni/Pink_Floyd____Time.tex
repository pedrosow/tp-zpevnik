\zp{Time}{Pink Floyd}

\zs
<F#mi>Ticking away the moments that make up a <A>dull day

You <E>fritter and waste the hours in an off hand <F#mi>way

<F#mi>Kicking around on a piece of ground in your <A>home town

<E>Waiting for someone or something to show you the <F#mi>way
\ks

\zs
<Dmaj7>Tired of lying in the sunshine <Amaj7>staying home to watch the rain

<Dmaj7>You are young and life is long and <Amaj7>there is time to kill today

<Dmaj7>And then one day you find <C#mi7>ten years have got behind you

<Hmi7>No one told you when to run, <E>you missed the <E7>starting gun
\ks

\zs
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking

And racing around to come up behind you again

The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older

Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
\ks

\zs
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time

Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way

The time is gone, the song is over, <Hmi7>thought I'd something <F>more to <Emi>say
\ks

\kp
