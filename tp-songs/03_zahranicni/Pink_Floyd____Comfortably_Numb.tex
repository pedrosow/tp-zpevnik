<Hmi>Hello.

<Hmi>Is there anybody <A>in there? 

Just nod if you can <G>hear me<Emi>

Is there <Hmi>anyone home?
\ks

\zs
Come on, now

I hear you’re feeling down

Well I can ease your pain

Get you on your feet again
\ks

\zs
Relax

I need some information first

Just the basic facts:

Can you show me where it hurts? 
\ks

\zr
<D>There is no pain, you are <A>receding

<D>A distant ship’s smoke on the ho<A>rizon

<C>You are only coming through in <G>waves

<C>Your lips move but I can’t hear <G>what you’re sayin’

<D>When I was a child I had <A>a fever

<D>My hands felt just like two ball<A>oons

<C>Now I got that feeling once a<G>gain

I can’t explain, you would not under<C>stand

This is not how I am <G>

<A>I <G>have beco<D>me comfortably <A>numb

OK,
just a little pinprick

There’ll be no more -- aaaaaahhhhh!

But you may feel a little sick
\ks

\zs
Can you stand up? 

I do believe it’s working, good

That’ll keep you going for the show

Come on, it’s time to go
\ks

\zr
There is no pain, you are receding

A distant ship’s smoke on the horizon

You are only coming through in waves

Your lips move but I can’t hear what you’re sayin’

When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse

Out of the corner of my eye

I turned to look but it was gone

I cannot put my finger on it now

The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb
