<E7>You keep saying you've got something for me

Something you call love, but confess

<A7>You've been messing where you shouldn't be messing

And now <E7>someone else is getting all your best

These <G>boots are made for <E>walking

And <G>that's just what they'll <E>do

<G>One of these day these <E>boots are gonna

Walk all over you

You keep lying when you ought to be truthing

And you keep losing when you ought to not bet

You keep sameing when you ought to be a-changing

Now what's right is right but you ain't been right yet

\zs
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing

And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha!

I just found me a brand new box of matches

And what he knows you ain't had time to learn
\ks

\zr\kr

Are you ready, boots? Start walking!
