<D>Big <Cmaj7>wheels keep on <G>turning.
Carry me home to see my kin!

Singing songs about the Southland,
I miss Alabama once again

And I think it's a sin, yes
\ks

\zs
Well I heard mister Young sing about her

Well, I heard ole Neil put her down

Well, I hope Neil Young will remember

A Southern man don't need him around anyhow
\ks

Sweet home Alabama
where the skies are so blue

Sweet Home Alabama,
Lord, I'm coming home to you
\kr

\zs
In Birmingham they love the governor

Now we all did what we could do

Now Watergate does not bother me

Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

\zs
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers

And they've been known to pick a song or two

Lord they get me off so much

They pick me up when I'm feeling blue.
Now how about you?
\ks

\zr
Sweet home Alabama,
oh sweet home, baby

Where the skies are so blue
and the governor's true
\kr

\zr
Sweet Home Alabama, Lordy, Lord, I'm coming home to you

Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer
