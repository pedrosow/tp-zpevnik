<Gmi>Remember when you were young,
<F#>you shone like the <B>sun

<Es>Shine <Es/D>on you <Cmi>cra<Cmi/Bb>zy <F>diamond

<Gmi>Now there's a look in your eyes
<F#>like black holes in the <B>sky

<Es>Shine <Es/D>on you <Cmi>cra<Cmi/Bb>zy <F>diamond

You were <Gmi>caught in the crossfire
<Gmaj7/F#>of childhood and stardom

<Gmi7/F>Blown on the steel <C9>breeze

<Es>Come on you target for <Edim>faraway laughter

<B/F>Come on you stranger, you <Dmi>legend, you <D7>martyr, and <Gmi>shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
you cried for the moon

Shine on you crazy diamond

Threatened by shadows at night
and exposed in the light

Shine on you crazy diamond

Well you wore out your welcome
with random precision

Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you raver, you seer of visions

Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
how near or how far

Shine on you crazy diamond

Pile on many more layers,
and I'll be joining you there

Shine on you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,
sail on the steel breeze

Come on you boy child, you winner and loser

Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine!
