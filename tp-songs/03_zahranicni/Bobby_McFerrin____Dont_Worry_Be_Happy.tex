<G>Here's a little song I wrote 

You <Ami>might want to sing it note for note 

Don't <C>worry be <G>happy

In every life we have some trouble

When you worry you make it double 

Don't worry, be happy (don't worry, be happy now)
\ks

\zr
Don't worry 

Be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry

Be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head 

Somebody came and took your bed

Don't worry, be happy 

The landlord says your rent is late 

He may have to litigate 

Don't worry, be happy 

(Look at me I am happy)
\ks

\zr
Don't worry, be happy 

Here, I give you my phone number 

When you worry call me

I make you happy 

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style 

Ain't got no girl to make you smile 

But don't worry be happy

Cause when you worry your face will frown 

And that will bring everybody down 

So don't worry, be happy 

(Don't worry, be happy now)

Now there is this song I wrote 

I hope you learn it note for note 

Like good little children 

Don't worry, be happy 

Listen to what I say: 

In your life expect some trouble 

When you worry you make it double 

But don't worry

Be happy, be happy now

Don't worry 

Don't worry, don't do it, be happy 

Put a smile on your face 

Don't bring everybody down like this 
\ks

\zr
Don't worry

It will soon pass, whatever it is 

Don't worry, be happy 

I'm not worried, I'm happy
