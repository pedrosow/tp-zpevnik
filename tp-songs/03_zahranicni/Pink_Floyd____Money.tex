<Hmi7>Money, get away

Get a good job with more pay and you're okay

Money, it's a gas

Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

Money, get back

I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack

Money, it's a hit

Don't give me that do goody good bullshit

I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set

And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime

Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie

Money, so they say

Is the root of all evil today

\ks

\zr
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're

Giving none away
