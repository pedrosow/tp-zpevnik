\zp{Ironic}{Alanis Morisette}

\zs
An <F#>old <H>man <F#>turned ninety-<G#mi>eight.
He won the lottery and died the next day

It's a black fly in your chardonnay.
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

Isn't it <F#>ironic? <H> Don't you <F#>think <G#mi>
\ks

\zr
It's like <F#>ra<H>in on your <F#>wedding <G#mi>day.
It's a free <F#>ri<H>de when you've <F#>already <G#mi>paid

It's the good ad<F#>vi<H>ce that you <F#>just didn't <G#mi>take

<A>And who would have <G#mi>thought... it <F#>figures
\kr

\zs
Mr. Play-it-safe was afraid to fly

He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye

He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight

And as the plane crashed down he thought ``Well isn't this nice...''

And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
\ks

\zs
Well, <H>life has a funny way of sneaking <F#>up on you

When you think everything is okay and <G#mi>everything's going right

And <H>life has a funny way of helping <F#>you out when

You think everything's gone wrong and <G#mi>everything blows up in your face
\ks

\zs
A traffic jam when you are already late

A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break

It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife

It's like meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his beautiful wife

And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

A little too ironic. And yeah I really do think
\ks

\zs
<H>Life has a funny way of sneaking up on <F#>you

<H>Life has a funny, funny way <F#>of helping you <H>out, helping you out
