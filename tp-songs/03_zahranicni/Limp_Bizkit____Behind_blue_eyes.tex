<Emi>No one knows what it's <G>like
to be the <D>bad man

To be the <C>sad man
be<A>hind blue eyes

And no one knows
what it's like to be hated

To be fated to telling only lies
\ks

\zr
But my <C>dre<D>ams they aren't as <G>empty

As my <C>conscience <D>seems to <E4>be <Emi>

I have <Hmi>hours, only <C>lonely

My love is <D>vengeance

That's never <A>free

No one knows what its like
to feel these feelings

Like I do, and I blame you

No one bites back as hard on their anger

None of my pain and woe can show through
\ks

\zs
No one knows what its like
to be mistreated

To be defeated behind blue eyes

No one know how to say that they're sorry

And don't worry I'm not telling lies
\ks

\zs
No one knows what its like
to be the bad man

To be the sad man
behind blue eyes
