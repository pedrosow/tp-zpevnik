<Ami>She would <G>never <F>say <G>where she came <C>from <F> <C>

<Ami>Yesterday <G>don't <F>matter <C>if it's <G>gone <C> <G>

<Ami>While the <D7>sun is <G>bright

Or <Ami>in the <D7>darkest <G>night

No one <C>knows <F> <C> she comes and <G>goes <C> <G>

<C>Good<G>bye <C>Ruby Tuesday

<C>When you <G>change with <F>ev'ry new day

<G>Still I'm gonna <C>miss you <G>

Don't question why she needs to be so free

She'll tell you it's the only way to be

She just can't be chained

To a life where nothing's gained

And nothing's lost at such a cost

There's no time to loose I heard her say

Cash your dream before they slip away

Dying all the time

Lose your dreams and you

Will loose your mind, ain't life unkind
