I <A>hate the world today. <E> <D>

You're so good to me I <A>know but I can't change <E> <D>

Tried to tell you but you <F#mi>look at me like maybe

I'm and <H7>angel underneath <D>innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried. You must have been relieved to see the softer side

I can understand how you'd be so confused I don't envy you

I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one
\ks

\zr
I'm a <A>bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a <E>child I'm a mother

I'm a <Hmi>sinner, I'm a saint, I <D>do not feel ashamed

I'm your <A>hell, I'm your dream, I'm <E>nothing in between

You know you <F#mi>wouldn't want it any other <D>way
\kr

\zs
So take me as I am. This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man

Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous

And I'm going to extreme tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

<E>Just when you think you got me figured out <F#mi>the season's 
already <D>changin'

<E>I think it's cool you <F#mi>do what ya do and <D>don't try 
to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees

When you hurt, when you suffer, I'm your angel undercover

I've been numb, I'm revived, can't say I'm not alive

You know I wouldn't want it any other way
