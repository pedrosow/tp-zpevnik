Father
\zs
It's not <G>time to make a <D>change, just <C>relax, take it <Ami7>easy

You're still <G>young, that's your <Emi>fault, there's so <Ami>much you have to <D>know

Find a <G>girl, settle <D>down, if you <C>want you can <Ami7>marry

Look at <G>me, I am <Emi>old but I'm <Ami>happy <C> <D>
\ks

\zs
I was <G>once like you are <Bmi7>now, and I <C>know that it's not <Ami7>easy

To be <G>calm when you've <Emi>found something going <Ami>on <C> <D>

But take your <G>time, think a <Bmi7>lot, think <C>of everything you'<Ami7>ve got

For you will <G>still be here to<Emi>morrow, but your <D>dreams may <G>not <G/C> <G/C>
\ks

Son
\zs
How can <G>I try to <Bmi>explain, when I <C>do he turns away a<Ami7>gain

It's <G>always been the <Emi>same, same old <Ami>story <C> <D>

From the <G>moment I could <Bmi>talk I was <C>ordered to <Ami7>listen

Now there's a <G>way and I <Emi>know that I <D>have to <G>go away

I <D>know I <C>have to <G>go <G/C> <G/C>\\

Father
\zs
It's not time to make a change, just sit down, take it slowly

You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry

Look at me, I am old but I'm happy
\ks

Son
\zs
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside

It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them, they know not me

Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

I know I have to go
