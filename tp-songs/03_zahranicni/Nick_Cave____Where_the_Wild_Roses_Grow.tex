\zp{Where the wild roses grow}{Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave}

\zr
They <Emi>called me The Wild <Ami>Rose

<Emi>But my <G>name was Elisa <H>Day

Why they <Emi>called me it I do not <Ami>know

<Emi>For my name was <D>Elisa <Emi>Day
\kr

He:
\zs
From the <Emi>first day I saw her I knew <G>she was the one 

She <Ami>stared in my eyes and <H>smiled

For her <Emi>lips were the color of the <G>roses 

That <Ami>grew down the river, all <H>bloody and wild

Elisa:
\zs
When he knocked on my door and entered the room

My trembling subsided in his sure embrace

He would be my first man, and with a careful hand

He wiped the tears that ran down my face

He:
\zs
On the second day I brought her a flower

She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen

I said: ``Do you know where the wild roses grow

So sweet and scarlet and free?''
\ks


Elisa:
\zs
On the second day he came with a single rose

Said: ``Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?''

I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed

He said: ``If I show you the roses will you follow?''

Elisa:
\zs
On the third day he took me to the river

He showed me the roses and we kissed

And the last thing I heard was a muttered word

As he stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist 
\ks

He:
\zs
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow

She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief

And I kissed her goodbye, I said: ``All beauty must die''

And I lent down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth 
\ks
\zr
They called me The Wild Rose but my name was Elisa Day

Why they called me it I do not know

3Ã— /: For my <Emi>name was <D>Elisa <Emi>Day :/
