\zp{Wind of change}{Scorpions}

\zs
<C>I follow the Mosk<Dmi>va down to Gorky <C>Park

Listening to the <Dmi>wind of <Ami>chan<G>ge

<C>An August summer <Dmi>night, soldiers passing <C>by

Listening to the <Dmi>wind of <Ami>chan<G>ge
\ks

\zs
The world closing in Did you ever think

That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere

Blowing with the wind of change
\ks

\zr
<C>Take <G>me to the <Dmi>magic of the <G7>moment on a <C>glory <G>night

Where the <Dmi>children of to<G>morrow dream <Ami>away in the wind of <G>change
\kr

\zs
Walking down the street distant memories

Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park

Listening to the wind of change
\ks

\zr
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change
\kr

\zs
<Ami>The wind of change blows <G>straight into the face of <Ami>time

Like a stormwind that will <G>ring the freedom bell for peace of <C>mind

Let your balalaika <Dmi>sing what my guitar wants to <E>say
\ks

\zr
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change
