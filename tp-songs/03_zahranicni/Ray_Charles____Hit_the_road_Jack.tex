Hit the <Ami>road, <G>Jack, <F>don't you come <E7>back

No more, no more, no more, no more

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean

You're the meanest woman I've ever seen

I guess if you say so

I'll have to pack my things and go

Now baby, listen baby, don't-a treat me this-a way

For I'll be back on my feet some day

Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood

You ain't got no money you just ain't no good


Well, I guess if you say so

I'd have to pack my things and go (that's right!)
