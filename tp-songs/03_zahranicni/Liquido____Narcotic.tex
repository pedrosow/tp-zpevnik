\zs

<C>So you face it with a <Dmi>smile 

There is no need to <F>cry

For a trifle's more than <C>this
\ks

\zs
Will you still recall my name

And the month it all began

Will you release me with a kiss
\ks

\zs
Have I tried to draw the veil

If I have -- how could I fail?

Did I fear the consequence?
\ks

\zr
<C>Dazed by careless <Dmi>words 

Cosy in my <F>mi<Dmi>nd <C> 

<C>I don't <Dmi>mind 

I think <F>so 

I will <C>let you go
\kr

\zs
Now you shaped that liquid wax

Fit it out with crater cracks

Sweet devotion -- my delight
\ks

\zs
Oh, you're such a pretty one

And the naked thrills of flesh and skin

Would tease me through the night
\ks

\zs
``Now I hate to leave you bare

If you need me I'll be there

Don't you ever let me down''
\ks

\zs
Dazed by careless words

Cosy in my mind
\ks

\zs
And I touched your face

Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane
\ks

\zs
And I called your name

Like an addicted to cocaine calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
\ks

\zs
And I touched your face

Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane
\ks

\zs
And I called your name

My cocain 
\ks
