\zp{Losing my religion}{R.E.M.}

\zs
<Ami>Life is bigger,
<Emi>it's bigger than you

And you are <Ami>not me

The lengths that I will <Emi>go to,
the distance in your <Ami>eyes

<Emi>Oh no I've said too <Dmi>much,
I set it <G>up
\ks

\zs
That's me in the corner.
That's me in the spotlight

Losing my religion

Trying to keep up with you
and I don't know if I can do it

Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
\ks

\zr
I thought that I heard you <F>laughing,
I thought that I <G>heard you <Ami>sing

I <F>think I thought I saw <G>you <Ami>try <G>
\kr

\zs
Every whisper
of every waking hour

I'm choosing my confessions

Trying to keep an eye on you
like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool

Oh no I've said too much,
I set it up
\ks

\zs
Consider this
the hint of the century

Consider this

The slip that brought me
to my knees failed

What if all these fantasies
come flailing around

Now I've said too much
\ks

\zr
I thought that I heard you laughing,
I thought that I heard you sing

I think I thought I saw you try
\kr

\zr
But <C>that was just a <Dmi>dream,
<C>that was just a <Dmi>dream
\kr

\zs
That's me in the corner.
That's me in the spotlight ...
\ks

\zr
But <C>that was just a dream,
<Dmi>that was just a <C>dream

Just a <G>dream, just a <C>dream, dream <Ami>
