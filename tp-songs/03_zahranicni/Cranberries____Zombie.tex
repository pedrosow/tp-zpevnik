Another head hangs lowly

Child is slowly taken
 
And the violence caused such silence
 
Who are we mistaken?
 
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family

In your head, in your head they are fighting
\ks

\zr 
With their tanks, and their bombs

And their bombs, and their guns

In your head, in your head they are cryin'
 
In your head, in your head, Zombie, Zombie, Zombie - ie - ie

What's in your head, in your head

Zombie, Zombie, Zombie - ie - ie - ie - Emioh

<C> <G> <D> <Emi> <C> <G> <D> 

tu tu tu...

Another mother's breakin' 

Heart is taking over

When violence causes silence 

We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme since 1916

In your head, in your head they're still fightin'
\ks

..... ie - ie - ie - oh. oh oh oh oh oh oh ie-ah ah
