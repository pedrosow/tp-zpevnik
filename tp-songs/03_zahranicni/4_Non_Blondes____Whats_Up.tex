<A>Twent'-five years and my life is still

<Hmi>Trying to get up that great big hill of <D>hope

For a desti<A>nation

I realized quickly when I knew that I should

That the <Hmi>world was made of this brotherhood of <D>man

For whatever that <A>means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed

Just to get it all out what's in my head and I

I'm feeling a little peculiar

So I wake in the morning and I step outside and I

Take a deep breath and I get real high and I

Scream at the top of my lungs: ``What's going on?''

/: And I say: ``Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey''

I say: ``Hey, what's going on?'' :/
\kr

<A>Ooh, <Hmi>ooh, <D>ooh <A>

\zs
And I try, oh my God do I try, I try all the time, in this institution

And I pray, oh my God do I pray, I pray every single day for a revolution
