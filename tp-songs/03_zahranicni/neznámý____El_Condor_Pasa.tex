I'd <Ami>rather be a sparrow than a <C>snail

Yes I would, if I could, I surely <Ami>would

I'd rather be a hammer than a <C>nail

Yes I would, if I only could, I surely <Ami>would
\ks

\zr
A<F>way, I'd rather sail away

Like a <C>swan that's here and gone

A <F>man gets tied up to the ground

He gives the <C>world its saddest sound

Its saddest <Ami>sound

\zs
I'd rather be a forest than a street

Yes I would, if I could, I surely would

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet

Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
