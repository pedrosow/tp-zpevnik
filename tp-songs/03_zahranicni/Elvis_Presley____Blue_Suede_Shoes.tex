But don't you step on my blue suede shoes

Well you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can knock me down, step on my face

Slander my name all over the place

Do anything that you wanna do

But uh uh, honey, lay off of them shoes

And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well you can burn my house, steal my car

Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar

Do anything that you wanna do

But uh uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
