When you were here <G>before

Couldn't look you in the <B>eyes

You look like an <C>angel

Your skin makes me <Cmi>cry

You float like a <G>feather

In a beautiful <B>weather

I wish I was <C>special

You're so fucking <Cmi>special

I'm a <B>wierdo

What the hell am I doin' <C>here

I don't belong <Cmi>here
