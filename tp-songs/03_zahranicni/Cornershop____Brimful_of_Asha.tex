There's <A>dancing <E>behind <D>movie scenes

Behind the <A>movie scenes -- <E>Sadi <D>Rani

From the <A>morning, <E>past the <D>evening

Till the end of the <A>light

And the cinema aisles

We don't care about no government warning

About that promotion of the simple life

And the dams they are building
