<G>In the <D>town where <C>I was <G>born

<Emi>Lived a <Ami>man who <C>sailed the <D>sea

<G>And he <D>told us <C>of his <G>life

<Emi>In the <Ami>land of <C>subma<D>rines

So we sailed up to the sun

Till we found the sea of green

And we lived beneath the waves

In our Yellow Submarine

Yellow Submarine, <G>Yellow Submarine :/

And our friends are all on board

Many more of them live next door

And the band begins to play

As we live a life of ease

Every one of us has all we need

Sky of blue and sea of green

In our Yellow Submarine
