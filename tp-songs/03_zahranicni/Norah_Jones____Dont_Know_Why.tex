<Bbmaj7>I waited <Bb7>'til I saw the <Ebmaj7>sun <D+>

<Gmi7>I don't know <C7>why I didn't <F7sus>come <Bb>

I left you by the house of fun

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day

I wished that I could fly away

Instead of kneeling in the sand

Catching teardrops in my hand
\ks

My <Gmi7>heart is <C7>drenched in <F>wine <F7>

But <Gmi7>you'll be <C7>on my <F7>mind

Out across the endless sea

I would die in ecstasy

But I'll a bag of bones

Driving down the road alone

Something has to make you run

I don't know why I didn't come

I feel as empty as a drum

3× /: I don't know why I didn't come :/
