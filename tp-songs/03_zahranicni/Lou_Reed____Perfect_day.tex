<Ami>Just a <D>perfect day,
<G>drink Sangria <C>in the park

<F>And then later, when <Dmi>it gets dark,
we go <E>home

<Ami>Just a <D>perfect day,
<G>feed animals <C>in the zoo

<F>Then later a <Dmi>movie, too,
and then <E>home

\bigskip

Oh <A>it's such a <D>perfect day

<C#mi>I'm glad I spent it with <D>you

<A>Oh such a <E>perfect day

/: You just <F#mi>keep me <E>hanging <D>on :/

Just a perfect day,
problems all left alone

Weekenders on our own,
it's such fun

Just a perfect day,
you made me forget myself

I thought I was someone else,
someone good

\bigskip

Oh it's such a perfect day

I'm glad I spent it with you

Oh such a perfect day

/: You just keep me hanging on :/

<C#mi>You're going to <G>reap just what you <D>sow <A>
:/
