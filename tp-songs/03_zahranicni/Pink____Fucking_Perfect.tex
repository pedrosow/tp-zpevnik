\zp{Fucking perfect}{Pink}

\zs
Made a <G>wrong turn, once <Dsus>or twice.
Dug my <Emi7>way out, blood and <Cadd9>fire

Bad decisions. That's alright, welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood. Miss ``No way it's all good''

It didn't slow me down. Mistaken. Always second guessing

Underestimated, look, I'm still around
\ks

\zr
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel

Like your less than, fuckin' perfect

Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel

Like your nothing, you're fuckin perfect to me

\zs
You're so mean. When you talk about yourself, you are wrong

Change the voices in your head. Make them like you instead

So complicated. Look happy, you'll make it

Filled with so much hatred. Such a tired game

It's enough. I've done all I can think of

Chased down all my demons. See you do the same
\ks

\zs
The whole world's scare so I swallow the fear

The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer

So cool in line and we try, try, try

But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time

Done looking for critics, cuz they're everywhere

They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair

Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time

Why do we do that

Why do I do that

Why do I do that
