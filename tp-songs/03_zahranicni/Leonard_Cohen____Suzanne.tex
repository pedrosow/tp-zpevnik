<E>Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river

You can <A>hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her

And you <E>know that she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there

And she <G#mi>feeds you tea and oranges <A>that come all the way from China

And just <E>when you mean to tell her <A>that you have no love to give her

She gets <E>you on her wavelength and she <F#mi>lets her river answer that you've <E>always been her lover
\ks
\zr
And you <G#mi>want to travel with her, you <A>want to travel blind

And you <E>know that she can trust you 

For you've <A>touched her perfect body with you <E>mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water

And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower

And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him

He said: ``All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them''

But he himself was broken long before the sky would open

Forsaken, almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
\ks
\zr
And you want to travel with him, you want to travel blind

And you think maybe you'll trust him

For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river

She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters

And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour

And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers

There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning

They are leaning out for love, they will lean that way forever while Suzanne holds the mirror
\ks
\zr
And you want to travel with her, you want to travel blind

And you know that you can trust her

For she's touched your perfect body with her mind
