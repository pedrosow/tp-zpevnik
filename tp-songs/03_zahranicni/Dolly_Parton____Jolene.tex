Your beauty is beyond compare
with flaming locks of auburn hair,
with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring,
your voice is soft like summer rain
and I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep,
there's nothing I can do to keep
from crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand 
how you could easily take my man,
but you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
\ks

\zs
You could have your choice of men
but I could never love again,
he's the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you,
my happines depends on you,
whatever you decide to do, Jolene
\ks
